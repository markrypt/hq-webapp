    <h2>3. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services employ cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, scripts, and other similar tracking technologies to improve functionality and user experience. These technologies collect and store information when you visit or interact with our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These cookies are strictly necessary for the basic functionality of our Services. They enable core features such as security, network management, account authentication, and remembering your preferences. You cannot opt out of these cookies as our Services cannot function properly without them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Functional Cookies:</strong> These cookies enhance the functionality of our Services by storing preferences beyond what is strictly required. They remember choices you make, such as language preferences, font size, or region, and provide enhanced, personalized features.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> We use these cookies to collect information about how you use our Services, including which pages you visit most frequently, how you navigate through the site, and whether you encounter any error messages. The data collected is aggregated and used to improve how our Services work. We primarily use Google Analytics for this purpose, which processes your data according to its own privacy policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> These cookies track your browsing habits and activity to build a profile of your interests. They are used to deliver targeted advertising that is relevant to you. They also limit the number of times you see an ad and help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cookie Management:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings. You can typically delete existing cookies, block certain types of cookies, or set your browser to notify you when cookies are being placed on your device. However, removing or blocking cookies may impact your experience and limit certain functionalities of our Services. For more detailed information about cookies and how to manage them, please refer to our Cookie Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Do Not Track:</strong> Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Due to the lack of a common understanding of how to interpret these signals, our Services currently do not respond to Do Not Track signals.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Links and Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services contain links to and integrations with third-party websites, applications, and services, including affiliate links to retailers such as Amazon. Additionally, we may use third-party services that collect information independently from our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Affiliate Marketing:</strong> We participate in affiliate marketing programs, including the Amazon Associates Program. When you click on affiliate links on our Services, a tracking cookie is placed on your device. If you subsequently make a purchase on the affiliate partner's site, we may receive a commission. These affiliate links and the associated cookies are subject to the privacy policies of our affiliate partners. Their tracking mechanisms operate independently from our Services, and we do not have access to or control over the information they collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>External Services:</strong> Our Services may integrate third-party services such as social media platforms, payment processors, analytics providers, and advertising networks. These services may collect information from you directly, including your IP address, device information, and browsing activities. Their collection and use of your information are governed by their respective privacy policies, which may differ from ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> We exercise due diligence in selecting third-party partners and service providers. However, we have no control over and assume no responsibility or liability for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services. We strongly advise you to review the privacy policies of all third-party websites and services you visit or use in connection with our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Transfers:</strong> When you follow links to third-party websites or use integrated services, your information may be transferred outside our secure environment. We cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to or through third-party services, and you provide such information at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      We exercise caution in sharing your information and do so only in the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage trusted third-party service providers to perform essential functions on our behalf. These providers include hosting services, analytics companies, customer support services, email delivery platforms, and payment processors. They have access to your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated to protect your information and not use it for other purposes. We implement rigorous selection procedures and require these providers to maintain appropriate security measures consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Affiliate Partners:</strong> When you interact with affiliate links on our Services, information about your interaction may be shared with our affiliate partners. This typically includes click data, IP address, and timestamp, which enable tracking of conversions and calculation of commissions. Our affiliate partners may have their own privacy policies governing their use of your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be transferred or sold as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law. We will notify you of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information via prominent notice on our website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or governmental requests; (b) enforce our Terms of Service and other agreements, including investigation of potential violations; (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users, us, or the public, as required or permitted by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with third parties when you explicitly consent to such sharing. In such cases, we will make it clear what information will be shared and with whom before obtaining your consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may share aggregated, anonymized, or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you with third parties for various purposes, including data analysis, research, service improvement, and marketing.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement and maintain reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. Our security measures include encryption of sensitive data, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, monitoring for vulnerabilities and threats, access controls, and staff training.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, no electronic transmission or storage system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of your personal information. We urge you to take steps to keep your personal information secure, such as choosing a strong password and keeping your login information confidential.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of a security breach that affects your personal information, we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of the breach and notify affected individuals as required by applicable law. This notification will typically be provided via email or prominent notice on our website, and will include information about the breach and steps you can take to protect yourself from potential harm.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Operational Necessity:</strong> We retain information needed for day-to-day business operations, service delivery, and related activities for as long as you use our Services and maintain an account with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> We retain information as required by applicable laws and regulations, including tax, financial reporting, audit requirements, and other legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Contractual Requirements:</strong> We retain information necessary to enforce our agreements, establish legal claims, and defend against potential legal actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When personal information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we securely delete or anonymize it. If anonymization is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store the information and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. We are committed to honoring these rights and providing you with reasonable access to and control over your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Access:</strong> You have the right to request information about the personal data we hold about you. Upon verification of your identity, we will disclose the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which it was collected, our purpose for collecting the information, and the categories of third parties with whom we have shared your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate personal information we maintain about you. We will process such requests taking into account the nature of the information and the purposes of processing the information.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Erasure:</strong> Under certain circumstances, you have the right to request deletion of your personal information from our records. We will comply with such requests unless retention is necessary to comply with legal obligations, detect fraud, enforce agreements, or protect our or another person's rights, property, or safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Restriction:</strong> You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information under specific circumstances, such as when you contest the accuracy of your personal information or object to our processing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> You have the right to receive a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit this information to another controller without hindrance, where technically feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Object:</strong> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information based on legitimate interests, including profiling. You also have the right to object to the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights. This means we will not deny services, charge different prices, or provide a different quality of service based solely on your decision to exercise your rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information provided in the Contact section of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request within the timeframe required by applicable law. To protect your privacy, we may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services are not designed for or directed toward individuals under the age of 13 (or higher age as required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information from a child, please contact us immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we offer features in the future that might collect information from children, we will comply with applicable laws and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting such information. Parents will have the right to review, have deleted, and prohibit further collection or use of their child's information.
    </p>

    <h2>13. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
      We operate globally, which means your information may be transferred to, stored in, and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have data protection laws that differ from those of your country. When we transfer your information internationally, we implement appropriate safeguards to ensure your information remains protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      These safeguards may include data transfer agreements incorporating standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or other relevant authorities, certification mechanisms, binding corporate rules, or other legal mechanisms designed to ensure an adequate level of protection for your personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      By using our Services, you acknowledge and consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information in countries outside your place of residence. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, please note that some of the entities we share information with may be located in countries that do not provide the same level of data protection as your home country.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have questions about our international data transfer practices or the safeguards we employ, please contact us using the information provided in the Contact section.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it regularly. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective when posted. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email (sent to the email address specified in your account), by means of a notice on our Services prior to the change becoming effective, or as otherwise required by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your continued use of our Services after any changes to this Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to the modified Privacy Policy, you should discontinue your use of our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will always indicate the effective date of the latest version of our Privacy Policy at the beginning of this document. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about our information practices.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      If you have a complaint or dispute about how we handle your personal information, please contact us first, and we will attempt to resolve the issue directly with you. If you are not satisfied with our response, depending on your location, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or other regulatory agency. We are committed to working with you to reach a fair resolution of any privacy concern or complaint.
    </p>

    <h2>16. Limitations of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use our Services; (b) any unauthorized access to or use of our servers and/or any personal information stored therein; (c) any interruption or cessation of transmission to or from our Services; (d) any bugs, viruses, trojan horses, or the like that may be transmitted to or through our Services by any third party; or (e) any errors or omissions in any content or for any loss or damage incurred as a result of the use of any content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through our Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      These limitations will apply regardless of whether we have been informed of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for certain types of damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
    </p>
