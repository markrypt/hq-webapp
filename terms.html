    <p>
      SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

    </p>
    <p>
      This indemnification obligation will survive the termination or expiration of these Terms and your use of the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>15. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your access to all or any part of the Services, with or without notice, for any reason, including, without limitation, breach of these Terms.

    </p>

    <h2>16. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration between you and Markrypt, except that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless you and Markrypt agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      You and Markrypt agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Markrypt each waive any right to a jury trial.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>
      YOU AND MARKRYPT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Markrypt agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
    </p>

    <h2>18. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    </p>

    <h2>19. Severability</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render these Terms unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provision shall be deleted without affecting the remaining provisions herein.
    </p>

    <h2>20. Entire Agreement</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other policies or rules posted by us on the Services constitute the entire agreement between you and Markrypt regarding the Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between you and Markrypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Markrypt. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.
    </p>

    <h2>21. Assignment</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Markrypt without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.
    </p>
